# SQL
## What is SQL ?
The Structured Query Language (SQL) is designed to communicate with databases and widely used for most relational database systems. It can be used for creating, accessing and manipulating which allows for searching, storing, updating, editing, retrieving and deleting data from a database.

## Creating a Database
I created 2 databases and created tables with a primary key and datatypes. The tables in these databases contain customers personal information and customers oder details.
