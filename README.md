# SQL
## What is SQL ?
The Structured Query Language (SQL) is designed to communicate with databases and widely used for most relational database systems. It can be used for creating, accessing and manipulating which allows for searching, storing, updating, editing, retrieving and deleting data from a database.

## Creating a database, running complex queries & joining tables
I created 2 databases and created tables in each database. The tables contain customers personal information and order details. I created a relational database by joining the tables from the databases to jointhe customers personal and order details into one table to make it easier to view and retrieve data.
